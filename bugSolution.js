The solution involves using a conditional check to ensure the `useNavigate` hook is initialized before calling `navigate`.  One approach is to utilize the `useEffect` hook with a dependency on the `navigate` function itself. This ensures that the redirect happens only after the component has fully mounted and the `useNavigate` hook has been initialized.

```javascript
//Solution Code
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (navigate) {
      navigate('/dashboard'); // Redirect after component mount
    }
  }, [navigate]);

  return (
    <div>My Component</div>
  );
}
```
Alternatively, you can refactor to conditionally render your navigation based on the availability of `navigate`.
