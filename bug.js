In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that hasn't fully mounted or rendered.  This often happens when trying to redirect immediately within a component's `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array `[]`. Because the component isn't fully rendered yet, `useNavigate` might not be properly initialized, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

```javascript
//Buggy Code
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    navigate('/dashboard'); // This might fail
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>My Component</div>
  );
}
```
